## **Introduction**
This project is my attempt at Task 3 of the Python Developer internship at LetsGrowMore. The goal is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors using Python.

## **Details**
* **<u>Project Title:</u>** *Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game using Python*
* **<u>Project Description:</u>** In this project, you will be going to program a very fun Python game. The goal of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to create a game that can be played from any computer, anywhere, and at any time. It should be possible to indicate the move with a single alphabet or by entering an entire string. We will use the `tkinter` and `random` Python modules to implement this.
